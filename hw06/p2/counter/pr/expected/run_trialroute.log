**WARN: (ENCEXT-1081):	Option '-effortLevel medium' specified by user is not used in preRoute stage. Its value will be used when engine mode is changed to postRoute.
Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 45nm process node: total_c_th=0, relative_c_th=1 and coupling_c_th=0.1.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including TQRC, IQRC and QRC extraction.
	Capacitance filtering mode(-capFilterMode option of the setExtractRCMode) is 'relAndCoup' for all engines.
	The accuracy mode for detail extraction will be set to 'high'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode will be 'medium' if QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.
Extraction called for design 'counter' of instances=24 and nets=36 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
Default RC Extraction called for design counter.
**WARN: (ENCEXT-6166):	Using capacitance table file without EXTENDED section is not recommended and will result in lower accuracy for clock nets in preRoute extraction and for all nets when using postRoute extraction -effortLevel low. Regeneration of full capacitance table is recommended.
