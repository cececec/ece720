Hello class,

I researched the parameters used to synthesize the DW_memctl module.  Unfortunately, the student who generated the modeule didn't document most of the parameters, and so I'm not 100% certain of which parameters were used.  It's probably safe to use the default parameters, however.  Here they are (this probably answers some of the questions that I'm asking you to investigate, but I'll leave it up to you to verify that the design matches these parameters).
